# Caesar-Cipher-String-Manipulation-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my data analytics skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the first project in this curriculum. I devised a Python script for this which used linear regression with SciPy, to produce two predictions of global sea level rise by 2050.
