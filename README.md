# Caesar-Cipher-String-Manipulation-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the first project in this curriculum. I devised two scripts for this ([Caesar-cipher.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Caesar-Cipher-String-Manipulation-Python-Project/blob/main/Caesar-cipher.py) and [Vigenere-cipher.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Caesar-Cipher-String-Manipulation-Python-Project/blob/main/Vigenere-cipher.py)), which used Python to produce Caesar and Vigenre cyphers respectively. These two cypher functions took and encoded input strings into cypher messages, by shifting the characters in these strings `n` letters forward in the alphabet. This was constant in the Caesar cypher and variable in the Vigenre cypher. The latter function could also be used to decipher said messages. The problem-solving thought process notes I produced when coding these functions are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Caesar-Cipher-String-Manipulation-Python-Project/blob/main/Cipher%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt). This aided in developing my skills with Python and scientific computing, in the context of functions and string manipulations, marking the completion of the first project in the course.
